Disrupt the District 2k17

This project was made during https://disrupt-the-district.devpost.com/

The purpose of the project ("Multiply") was to:

  1) Bridge the social gap between parties (democrat v. republican)
  2) Connect them over a socially conscious event or volunteering opportunity
  3) Let the non-profits post gigs they need help with for the users to take on
  
Simply put, it's like a gamification of social landscape -
Our aim was to demolish fake news and eliminate the misunderstanding / hate that other social media platforms may have suggested.
